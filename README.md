## keep_hydrated
Nathan loves cycling.

Because Nathan knows it is important to stay hydrated, he drinks 0.5 litres of water per hour of cycling.

You get given the time in hours and you need to return the number of litres Nathan will drink, rounded down.

For example:

time = 3 ----> litres = 1

time = 6.7---> litres = 3

time = 11.8--> litres = 5
## clock
Clock shows h hours, m minutes and s seconds after midnight.

Your task is to write a function which returns the time since midnight in milliseconds.

Example:

h = 0
m = 1
s = 1

result = 61000
Input constraints:

0 <= h <= 23
0 <= m <= 59
0 <= s <= 59
## invert value
Given a set of numbers, return the additive inverse of each. Each positive becomes negatives, and the negatives become positives.

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] --> [-1, -2, -3, -4, -5]
[1, -2, 3, -4, 5] --> [-1, 2, -3, 4, -5]
[] --> []
You can assume that all values are integers. Do not mutate the input array.
## repeated string
Write a function that accepts a non-negative integer n and a string s as parameters, and returns a string of s repeated exactly n times.

Examples (input -> output)

6, "I"     -> "IIIIII"
5, "Hello" -> "HelloHelloHelloHelloHello"
